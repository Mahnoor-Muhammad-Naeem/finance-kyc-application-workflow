# üè¶ Finance KYC Application Workflow Documentation

## üìÑ Overview

This repository documents the structured workflow for managing **Know Your Customer (KYC) Applications** within a dedicated project management platform (like ClickUp).

It provides a scalable, visual framework for the **Finance** team to manage, track, and process form submissions through defined stages, ensuring compliance and efficient review.

## ‚ú® Workflow Components

The workflow is established within a dedicated **Finance Space** and utilizes a nested structure to organize application tasks.

### 1. Finance Workspace Dashboard

The main dashboard provides an executive-level overview of the team's workload, resource allocation, and key recent activity. The **Workload by Status** chart is critical for capacity planning.

### 2. KYC Applications Board View

This is the **visual Kanban-style board** that represents the real-time status of all KYC applications.  
Tasks are separated into columns (`TO DO`, `IN PROGRESS`, `COMPLETE`) and can be dragged between stages.

**Key features in this view include:**
* **Task Cards:** Each card represents a customer form submission.
* **Priorities & Deadlines:** Clearly displayed on each card (`High`, `Normal`, `Urgent`) with due dates.
* **Attachments & Assignee:** Visible at a glance for easy tracking.
* **Columns:**  
  - **TO DO** ‚Üí New applications awaiting review.  
  - **IN PROGRESS** ‚Üí Applications under active review.  
  - **COMPLETE** ‚Üí Fully reviewed and approved applications.

### 3. KYC Applications List View

This is the primary operational view for the team. Tasks are grouped by their current **Status** (`IN PROGRESS` or `TO DO`), allowing for easy prioritization and assignment.

**Key features in this view include:**
* **Status Grouping:** Separates tasks awaiting review (`TO DO`) from those actively being processed (`IN PROGRESS`).
* **Custom Fields:** Visible columns for `Approval Level` and `Attachment` status for quick compliance checks.
* **Priority:** Clearly marked priority (Normal, High, Urgent) on each task.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

* **Platform:** Designed using a platform such as ClickUp, but the principles are transferable.
* **Naming Convention:** Task names (`Form Submission - #YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`) use a timestamp for unique identification and easy tracking.
* **Goal:** To transform a complex, document-heavy process into a trackable, transparent, and manageable workflow.
